# Neural.c
A MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) neural network implementation in plain C.

### Why
- Learn how neural networks work under the hood
- Lay foundation for future AI related projects

## Notes
#### Matrix vs tensor
- A matrix is a table of values arranged in rows and columns. There is no multi-dimensionality. (m x n)
- Tensor is a multi-dimensional array e.g array in array. m x n x p
